# Location-Search-Login
* This application is an extension of one of my projects "Location Search Application".
* In this part, I have appended <strong>client side validation</strong> for the application.
* In order to run this application, you have to download or clone this repository.
* Enter command "git clone https://github.com/adithyamahesh596/Location-Search-Login.git" to clone this repository.
* You should have <strong>MongoDB</strong> installed and running in your system.
* Now navigate into the repository and run command <strong>"npm install"</strong> to install the required dependencies.
* Now start the server using command <strong>"npm start"</strong>.
* For the complete functionality of the application, you must clone <strong>Location-Search-Api</strong> repository which provides <strong>Server Side Validation</strong>.
* So, you must start both the servers in the seperate terminals.
* Don't forget to have MongoDB running in your system by typing <strong>mongod</strong> in the new terminal.
